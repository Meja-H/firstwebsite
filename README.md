# first website
This is the first website I created in my second year of highschool

It is clearly very simple and quite small, my skills have developed from then.

This original website was created a little over a year ago,
It's purose was to expose me to the world of front end developing.

About Page:
- This website was suppose to be all about moi, so I do have a picture of myself, also this page has a short paragraph of my hobbies, including my tumblr.

- There is also a list of educational websites that I use frequently in my studies.

Pictures Page:
-Here is where I was first introduced to using images in a workspace, there is a little issue with the responsiveness of the pictures but I had not known of media queries at this point in my coding lifetime.

-Though it has been a whole year, I still have the same interests. Nothing has changed.

Favorites Page:
- We have a table on this page that needs to be centered, but again, I was only a novice at the time. 

- Same for this page, none of my favorites have changed.

Though this site is very mess and unruley, I enjoy seeing how much I've progressed in the little time I've had.
